# Team 18

> Please fill in this Readme with the required information, and delete this box.
>
> 1. Note that if you are using the `Windows Startup SPA Solution`, your target environment must be using either `Microsoft Visual Studio 2019` or `Microsoft Visual Studio 2022`.
>   If you are using `Cross-platform Startup SPA Solution`, you will need to decide on your target environment (see [Wiki](https://nus-cs3203.github.io/course-website/contents/tools/version-control-repository.html)).
>   Then, please enter the appropriate information below, giving details on the full toolchain (ie. OS, cmake and make versions.)
> 2. The `.gitigore` is already pre-configured, note that the included libraries files (ie. `Team00/Code00/lib`) must accompany this repository and not to be removed from the repository.
> 3. Put your test cases inside the correct directory (ie. `Team00/Tests00/`) not inside the scratch test directory (ie. `Team00/Code00/tests/`). The `.gitignore` is configured to prevent this.
> 4. If you encounter build issues, please visit the respective FAQ *before* reaching out for help:
>     1. [Windows-Startup-SPA-Solution FAQ](https://nus-cs3203.github.io/course-website/contents/tools/windows-spa.html#faq)
>     2. [Cross-platform-Startup-SPA-Solution FAQ](https://nus-cs3203.github.io/course-website/contents/tools/cross-platform-spa.html#faq)
> 5. Avoid using removed/deprecated features in C++, make sure you use features that exist in C++17. It is not recommended to use an earlier version of C++, if you want to proceed, please specify the C++ version specifically in the build configuration.
> 6. Please rename every reference of `00` (ie. `Team00/Code00`) to your own team number. Since the `.gitignore` is configured to ignore libs, remember to force add the autotester libs back to the repository by running `git add -f Team*/Code*/lib/` after you rename.
